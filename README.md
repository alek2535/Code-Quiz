# Code-Quiz

WEEK-4 Web-API Code-Quiz HW

## Description

The purpose of this project was to use some newly acquired JavaScript skills to create a coding quiz. Not only do you get to show off your new skills, but you also get to challenge yourself and others with a quiz about what you just learned. To complete this project there had to be a timer that counts down, with incorrect answers taking time away from the clock. This application must run in the browser and use JavaScript to dynamically update HTML and CSS of the application. As usual the application must be responsive and have a clean and neat user interface.

### Logic for Building Generator

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

## Contributing

Thank you to Carmen Obied, CJ Pia, and Zack Corpus who helped get me through this. Bouncing ideas off of each other and providing useful resources helped make this project successful.

## Project Status

This project is missing some functionality. I could not get the high scores page to show properly with the addEventListener on the Add Name button. There are a few other things that need to be cleaned up like removing the incorrect and correct statements so that don't stay for the length of the quiz.
